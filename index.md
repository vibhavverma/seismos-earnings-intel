## How It Works

Reports are generated using the `/earnings-intel` Claude Code skill, which:
1. Searches for earnings call transcripts across free sources
2. Extracts structured competitive intelligence per company
3. Scores each company's relevance to Seismos (CLF, acoustic sensing, completions tech)
4. Produces a cross-cutting executive summary and per-company analysis
