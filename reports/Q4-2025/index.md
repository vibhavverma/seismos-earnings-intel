### Medium Relevance — Detail Notes

- **APA** (APA Corporation): 
- **AR** (Antero Resources Corporation): Active completions operator setting frac efficiency records and focused on optimizing completion designs for HG Energy acreage. Emphasis on bigger completions and wider spacing. However, no specific mentions of CLF, acoustic sensing, real-time frac monitoring, or digital completions technologies.
- **BKV** (BKV Corporation): 
- **BP** (BP p.l.c.): 
- **CHRD** (Chord Energy Corporation): Actively trialing completions innovations including surfactant treatments and alternative well geometries. Early adopter mentality on technology when results merit. However, Bakken-focused with limited Permian exposure and only one full-time frac crew limits near-term CLF opportunity.
- **CLB** (Core Laboratories Inc.): Core Laboratories is adjacent to Seismos in the frac diagnostics space - their SpectraStim proppant tracers and Trimmer Frac Diagnostics directly evaluate completion effectiveness, the same outcome CLF/acoustic sensing targets. They are a potential competitor in diagnostics-as-a-service for operators evaluating completions. However, Core's approach is post-job chemical/tracer-based while Seismos provides real-time acoustic monitoring during pumping - making them potentially complementary rather than purely competitive. Worth monitoring as a partnership or competitive reference.
- **COP** (ConocoPhillips): Major completions spender with active efficiency improvement program. 15%+ D&C efficiency target and simul-frac adoption make them a strong CLF target account.
- **CPG** (Crescent Point Energy Corp. (now Veren Inc., acquired by Whitecap Resources May 2025)): Veren/Crescent Point was an active completions innovator in the Alberta Montney and Kaybob Duvernay, testing SPE completion designs and tracking per-well performance improvements. The focus on completion design optimization represents a potential entry point for Seismos technology. However, the company no longer exists as an independent entity (absorbed into Whitecap in May 2025). Future engagement would be through Whitecap Resources (WCP).
- **CRGY** (Crescent Energy Company): Active completions program with simulfrac adoption and extended laterals across Eagle Ford (core Seismos basin) and Uinta creates real-time frac optimization opportunity. 70% simulfrac penetration in South Texas and cost-efficiency focus make CLF/acoustic diagnostics a compelling add-on, though no technology vendors were named on the call.
- **CRK** (Comstock Resources, Inc.): Comstock is a major Haynesville completions spender ($1.4-1.5B capex) with active technology adoption including 20,000 PSI frac fleet upgrades and rotary steerable systems. The high-pressure Western Haynesville development and aggressive completions pace (48 wells to sales in 2026) present potential for frac diagnostics and optimization. No specific CLF or acoustic sensing mentions.
- **CTRA** (Coterra Energy Inc.): Major Permian operator with active Delaware Basin completions program and focus on completions optimization through landing zone development. Pending Devon merger will create massive combined completions operation. No specific frac technology mentions but scale of operations presents opportunity.
- **DVN** (Devon Energy): 
- **EC** (Ecopetrol S.A.): Ecopetrol operates in the Permian Basin (Midland) and explicitly discussed completions optimization including lower fracture pressures and new well designs as efficiency levers. As a significant Permian operator with active completion design work, there is a plausible entry point for Seismos CLF technology. However, no real-time frac monitoring or diagnostic technology was mentioned by name.
- **EOG** (EOG Resources): 
- **EXE** (Expand Energy Corporation): 
- **FANG** (Diamondback Energy): 
- **GPOR** (Gulfport Energy Corporation): Active completions operator focused on frac design optimization with science-driven approach (sidewall cores, logging for frac design). Completion efficiency dipped in 2025 and is a stated focus area. Collecting data to 'properly design fracs' in Marcellus North. However, no specific mentions of CLF, acoustic sensing, or real-time frac monitoring technologies.
- **KLXE** (KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc.): Direct completions services provider (wireline, coiled tubing, frac rentals, downhole tools). While no specific frac diagnostics or real-time monitoring mentions, their VISION Suite and completions tool innovation suggest openness to advanced completions technology. Potential channel partner or customer for Seismos CLF data integration with wireline/perf operations.
- **MTDR** (Matador Resources Company): Active completions technology adoption including surfactant-enhanced completions program, significant focus on frac efficiency and cost optimization, and AI integration plans. No specific mention of CLF, acoustic sensing, or frac diagnostics, but the completion efficiency and technology openness signals potential receptivity.
- **NINE** (Nine Energy Service, Inc.): Nine is a pure-play completions services company (cementing, wireline, completion tools, coiled tubing) operating in basins where Seismos is active. Their struggles with completion design changes and need for differentiation could make them receptive to frac diagnostic partnerships, though they don't currently mention any real-time monitoring technologies.
- **NOV** (NOV Inc): 
- **PTEN** (ProPetro Holding Corp (FILE MISMATCH - expected Patterson-UTI)): 
- **RRC** (Range Resources Corporation): Range is running an e-frac fleet under long-term contract and achieving industry-leading frac stage efficiency. While focused on capital efficiency rather than technology experimentation, their completions-intensive DUC harvest strategy and e-frac adoption indicate digital completions awareness. No CLF or frac diagnostics mentions.
- **SLB** (SLB (Schlumberger)): 
- **SM** (SM Energy Company): Large-scale multi-basin operator with 4.5 frac crews and 295 net completions planned in 2026. Permian receives 45% of capital. Active focus on applying best practices and increasing operational efficiencies across combined Civitas portfolio. However, no specific advanced completions technology mentions beyond longer laterals and deeper zones.
- **WCP** (Whitecap Resources): 
- **WFRD** (Weatherford International plc): Weatherford is expanding completions and interventions capabilities and investing in digital/AI optimization, but no specific mentions of acoustic sensing, real-time frac monitoring, or CLF technologies. Their completions focus is more on tools (gas-lift, flow-control) than frac diagnostics.
- **WTTR** (Select Water Solutions, Inc.): Select is deeply embedded in completions operations as a water logistics provider for simul-frac and tri-mod frac, which are the exact well designs where Seismos CLF technology adds value. No direct frac diagnostics or monitoring mentions, but their customer base and operational footprint overlap significantly with Seismos target operators.

## Market Themes

### 1. Completions Intelligence Is a Three-Horse Race

Halliburton (Zeus IQ), Liberty (Atlas IQ), and ProFrac/Seismos (CLF) are the main platforms competing for real-time completions optimization. Zeus IQ has the installed base advantage; Atlas IQ is the newest entrant; CLF has technical differentiation through acoustic sensing.

### 2. Simul-Frac Is Table Stakes

Multiple operators (CRGY 70%, COP, PR, EOG) run simul-frac as standard practice. This creates more complexity per stage — and more demand for real-time monitoring to ensure quality across simultaneous operations.

### 3. Efficiency Gains Are Plateauing

Several operators report slowing efficiency gains after years of optimization. This creates an opening for technology-driven step-changes like CLF rather than incremental operational improvements.

### 4. E-Frac Creates Infrastructure for Digital Completions

The shift to electric frac fleets (now standard for Tier 1 operators) brings better data acquisition capability — the sensors and connectivity required for real-time platforms like CLF.

### 5. International Markets Are Emerging

Canada (WCP, TCW), Argentina (YPF, VIST), and Colombia (EC) are ramping unconventional development. These are future CLF markets as operations mature.
